            Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply calibration. Force fields have been
            established
            on all turbo lifts and crawlways. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems. Antimatter
            containment
            positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. I read an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod.
            The
            bomb had a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies.

                Communication is not possible. The shuttle has no power. Using the gravitational pull of a star to
                slingshot
                back in
                time? We are going to Starbase Montgomery for Engineering consultations prompted by minor read-out
                anomalies.
                Probes
                have recorded unusual levels of geological activity in all five planetary systems. Assemble a team. Look
                at
                records
                of the Drema quadrant. Would these scans detect artificial transmissions as well as natural signals?

            Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector. According to coordinates, we have travelled 7,000
            light
            years and are located near the system J-25. Tractor beam released, sir. Force field maintaining our hull
            integrity.
            Damage report? Sections <sup>27</sup>, <sup>28</sup> and <sup>29</sup> on decks four, five and six
            destroyed.
            Without our shields, at this range
            it
            is probable a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise.
            <br>
            Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon torpedoes. Something strange on the
            detector
            circuit. The weapons must have disrupted our communicators. You saw something as tasty as meat, but
            inorganically
            materialized out of patterns used by our transporters. Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement
            in
            science, the beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All transporters off.

            We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic
            engineering
            by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and
            forgive me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an
            abundance
            of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.

            Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp reactor core primary coolant failure.
            Fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. <sup>We are the <sub>borg</sub>.</sup>
