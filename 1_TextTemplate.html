        I have reset the sensors to scan for frequencies outside the usual range. By emitting harmonic vibrations to
        shatter the lattices. We will monitor and adjust the frequency of the resonators. He has this ability of
        instantly interpreting and extrapolating any verbal communication he hears. It may be due to the envelope
        over
        the structure, causing hydrogen-carbon helix patterns throughout. I'm comparing the molecular integrity of
        that
        bubble against our phasers.

        It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral
        cortex,
        the brain stem, the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device like that
        would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular
        polarization. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the
        photons
        with phase discriminators.

        Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp reactor core primary coolant failure.
        Fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. Resistance is futile. Recommend we adjust shield harmonics to the
        upper
        EM band when proceeding. These appear to be some kind of power-wave-guide conduits which allow them to work
        collectively as they perform ship functions. Increase deflector modulation to upper frequency band.
